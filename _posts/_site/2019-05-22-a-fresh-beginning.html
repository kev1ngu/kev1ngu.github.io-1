<p>As I claimed in the <a href="https://www.imisscoverflow.xyz/about/"><em>About Page</em></a>, having a personal blog set up is a long-wanted thing on my bucket list.</p>

<p>Now the box is checked, finally.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s always surprising to have all these years wasted in wanting a personal blog but doing literally nothing. Crystal clearly I know that anyone in dream of writing something on the Internet should have a blog running indepently from these babysitters even not being tech-savvy, period.</p>

<p>The moment finnaly came, I made up my mind that I should jump out of the trap set by Qzone and many other blogging-like service provider like Jianshu (but thumbs up for Medium), and of course, my laziness. And, really do something.</p>

<p class="message">Thankfully I started out, and I won't call it a miss.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to make this a place where I can have a rest, like, <em>a home on the Internet</em>. It is expected that I will share new gadgets, trends, perspectives and thoughts on great works of liberal arts. If you see any older post, that would be my previous posts somewhere else(mostly in Chinese).</p>

<p>I am grateful to those who provide tools that I used during the setting up of this blog. Also i would like to thank my friends, families and my girlfriend to keep me company during my looooong feeling down.</p>

<p>Like Jeremy Clarkson said on his DriveTribe: <em>My Tribe, My Rules.</em></p>

<p>Yes, <em>My Blog, My Rules</em>.</p>
