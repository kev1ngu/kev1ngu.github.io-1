   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I claimed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imisscoverflow.xyz/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, having a personal blog set up is a long-wanted thing on my bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the box is checked, finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s always surprising to have all these years wasted in wanting a personal blog but doing literally nothing. Crystal clearly I know that anyone in dream of writing something on the Internet should have a blog running indepently from these babysitters even not being tech-savvy, period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment finnaly came, I made up my mind that I should jump out of the trap set by Qzone and many other blogging-like service provider like Jianshu (but thumbs up for Medium), and of course, my laziness. And, really do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Thankfully I started out, and I won't call it a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to make this a place where I can have a rest, like, &lt;em&gt;a home on the Internet&lt;/em&gt;. It is expected that I will share new gadgets, trends, perspectives and thoughts on great works of liberal arts. If you see any older post, that would be my previous posts somewhere else(mostly in Chinese).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to those who provide tools that I used during the setting up of this blog. Also i would like to thank my friends, families and my girlfriend to keep me company during my looooong feeling down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Jeremy Clarkson said on his DriveTribe: &lt;em&gt;My Tribe, My Rules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;My Blog, My Rules&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
